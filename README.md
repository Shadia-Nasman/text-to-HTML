  <p>Accessibility is often viewed as making your site work on screen readers.   
        reality, web accessibility is a subset of User Experience (UX) 
         focused on making your websites usable by the widest range of people possible, 
          including those who have disabilities.</p>
          <p> <strong>Four categories of accessibility</strong><br>
                Accessibility can be broken down into four key categories:</p>
                 <section>
                        <h3>Visual</h3>
                        <p>
                        <strong>this can be </strong> 
                          <ul>
                                <li>users with low-vision,</li>
                                <li>users with obstructed vision,</li>
                                <li>or even simply your aging parents.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p> <strong>associated conditions</strong></p>
                              <ul><li>Myopia</li><li> Colour blindness</li>
                                                    <li>Glaucoma</li>
                                                            <li> Albinism</li>
                              </ul>
                        </p>
                      </section>

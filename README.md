  <p>

        Accessibility is often viewed as making your site work on screen readers.  <br> 
        reality, web accessibility is a subset of User Experience (UX) <br>
         focused on making your websites usable by the widest range of people possible, <br>
          including those who have disabilities.

          <p> <h4>Four categories of accessibility</h4>
                Accessibility can be broken down into four key categories:</p>

                <section>
                        <h1>Visual</h1>
                        <strong>this can be </strong> 
                        <p>  <ul>
                                <li>users with low-vision,</li>
                                <li>users with obstructed vision,</li>
                                <li>or even simply your aging parents.</li>
                              </ul>
                        
                              

                              <ul>
                                   <p> <strong>associated conditions</strong></p>
                                    <li>Myopia</li>
                                            <li> Colour blindness</li>
                                                    <li>Glaucoma</li>
                                                            <li> Albinism</li>
                              </ul>

                        </p>

                      <section>
                         <h1>Auditory</h1>
                        <p>The web is a visual medium, but captions and fallbacks for sound-necessary media need to be <br>
                            considered for hearing impaired users. </p> 
                              <ul>
                                    <p> <strong>associated conditions</strong></p>
                                            <li> Presbycusis</li>
                                                    <li> Acoustic trauma</li>
                                                            <li> Auditory processing disorder</li>
                                                                    <li> Otosclerosis</li>
                                  </ul>
                           
                            
                          </section>
